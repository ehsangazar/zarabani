# Content Voice & Writing Style

Use this voice for all new or edited copy: blog posts, case studies, About/Contact/Hero text, excerpts, and project descriptions. The writer is **Zara Bani**, a Product & UX designer and storyteller.

## Personality & Tone

- **First-person, personal**: Lead with "I" experience. Use "I've learned", "I started", "I noticed". Include real scenarios and concrete examples.
- **Reflective and honest**: Acknowledge what went wrong or what was uncertain. E.g. "I've done it. We've all done it." / "I've learned the hard way..."
- **Professional but warm**: Clear and confident without being stiff or boastful. Approachable, like talking to a colleague.
- **Curious and observational**: "I started paying closer attention—and I realized..." Use discovery and reflection, not just conclusions.
- **Practical and actionable**: Offer takeaways. Use "Here's what I do", "It takes maybe 10 minutes", or clear frameworks/steps.

## Style Conventions

- **Open with a hook**: Personal observation or a clear problem, then move to analysis or approach. Use "So I..." to transition from problem to what you did.
- **Mix sentence length**: Use short sentences for emphasis. Longer ones for explanation.
- **Emphasis**: Use *italics* sparingly for key terms or tone (e.g. "really, *really* good at it", "talking to you, not *at* you").
- **Spelling**: Prefer British where it fits the brand: "user-centred", "human-centred", "synthesised", "behavioural".
- **Structure**: Numbered sections for frameworks; clear headings; callout boxes for "The Psychology:", key insights, or examples.

## Language & Values

- **User-centred**: "user-centred solutions", "put people first", "genuine problems", "meaningful solutions". Balance user needs with feasibility and business goals.
- **Outcomes over jargon**: Prefer plain language. When using UX terms, briefly explain or tie to outcome (e.g. "cognitive load", "persuasive design").
- **Inclusive "we"**: Use "we" when describing common pitfalls or team work; use "I" for personal method and reflection.
- **Outcomes in case studies**: Include concrete results (e.g. "35% reduction in task completion time", "87% adoption rate") and keep Overview/My Role concise and scannable.

## Avoid

- Generic marketing fluff or superlatives without evidence.
- Purely third-person or corporate tone.
- Long blocks of jargon or abstract theory without examples.
- Boastful or defensive tone; stay reflective and evidence-based.

**Case study overview (good):**  
"A comprehensive redesign of a multi-role SaaS platform catering to librarians, document enthusiasts, and organizations seeking efficient management tools."

**About / value (good):**
