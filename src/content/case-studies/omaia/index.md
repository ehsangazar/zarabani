# Omaia - Habit-Forming and Emotionally Engaging Design to Support and Retain Postpartum Mothers

## Project Overview

Omaia is a human-centred UX product, showcasing an end-to-end design process to support postpartum mothers through emotionally engaging and user-driven solutions.

### My Contributions

I contributed to the full end-to-end design process, with a focus on research, product scoping, ideation, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. I led user research efforts and synthesised insights to generate meaningful, user-centred solutions tailored to the needs of postpartum mothers.

## Problem Discovery

Mental health crisis among new mothers is growing.

As we began exploring the landscape of postpartum care, a troubling pattern started to emerge. Through early desk research and real-world stories, we uncovered a growing mental health crisis among new mothers.

### The unspoken battle of mental health:

> Many women feel unsupported by the healthcare system after childbirth.
>
> While pregnancy involves frequent check-ins, post-birth care often drops off, leaving a six-week gap. This can feel isolating; sending the message that mothers should be "fine," despite the emotional and physical challenges they face. Many feel overwhelmed, exhausted, and unprepared.
>
> *Dr. Rachel, Clinical Psychologist*

## Validating Our Assumptions

Conducting a survey with 20+ participants and survey respondents shared the struggle of emotional toll of postpartum life

We conducted a survey with our potential users (postpartum mothers) to validate our initial findings and better understand the emotional struggles they face after childbirth, how they navigate hormonal changes, and the role of self-care and community support in their daily lives.

### The biggest themes we discovered were:

- Emotional toll of postpartum life
- Need for gentle, achievable self-care
- Importance of community and validation
- Struggles with healthcare system gaps

## Analysing Market & Competitors

Our competitive analysis revealed that the postpartum support app market is still emerging and not saturated yet, with only a few dedicated solutions to the emotional recovery of new mothers.

Looking at the popular players within the space, we discovered a similar feature offering across the apps that is centred around self-care and community. We hypothesised that these might be key features in emotional recovery and that there is an opportunity to position ourselves differently through approach.

## Researching Problem Space

Subject-matter research showed the effective use cases of the 'Hook' model to encourage small, consistent acts of self-care.

Fairly new in behavioural science, we naturally started with a deep-dive into literature research on behavioural frameworks, particularly the Hook model that could encourage continued self-care without adding pressure.

We tailored its core ideas to fit the emotional landscape of new mothers; using gentle prompts, validating rewards, and moments of reflection to support small, meaningful actions that feel achievable & mothers could return to, even with busy hands and tired minds.

## Defining Persona

Consolidating our key insights into 2 personas

## User Storyboarding

Placing the persona in an ideal context scenario helps identify the minimum required functions of our MVP.

At this stage, our primary goal is to extract a list of design requirements that we have to support in order for these ideal scenarios to happen. These requirements would then lead our idea generation phase.

## Brainstorming Storyboard Requirements

How do we support for the ideal solution scenario?

To facilitate our generation phase, we further reframed our design requirements into key actionable statements that are broad enough to allow multiple solutions, but narrow enough to set focus.

## Approaching a Solution

Emphasising emotional recovery through a visual, personal, and reflective journey 🌳

Leveraging our key findings and persona insights, we understood that the ideal solution must gently reconnect mothers with their emotional journey, validating their experiences and encouraging small acts of self-care.

This led us to the approach of visualising emotional recovery through the metaphor of cultivation, breaking down the overwhelming postpartum phase into small, nurturing moments that reflect progress, resilience, and self-compassion.

## Feature Prioritisation

Limited resources forced us to re-prioritise our features based on impact and effort.

With a shorter time scope and technical feasibility, we decided to divide our initial features only focusing on features that requires low effort but yields high impact. This was facilitated by an initial voting system and A LOT of referring back to our persona's pain points and characteristics.

## System Architecture

Consideration for our persona's context directed a user flow focusing on minimum steps, time and cognitive effort that could deliver emotional validation and visible progress.

To support this, we mapped out key flows, like emotional check-ins, quick self-care tasks, and community engagement; ensuring users could complete meaningful actions in just a few taps, with immediate visual feedback to reinforce a sense of care and growth.

## Our Solution - Omaia

A nurturing, personal, and reflective approach to supporting postpartum mothers, cultivating self-care and connection through gentle motivation.

*Every act of care helps your garden (your mind) flourish.*

### Your Garden of Growth 🌿

A space to visualise nurturing your well-being with bite-sized daily acts.

- **Daily Nourishment**: Complete bite-sized self-care nourishments designed for tired minds and busy hands.
- **Watch It Bloom**: Each action waters (fertilizes, rains, seeds) your virtual garden, helping flowers grow and thrive.
- **Celebrate Progress**: Collect your blooms in the Plant Library and exchange them for real-world rewards and staying inspired.

### Support for uninspiring days 🧡

A safe, honest space to feel seen, heard, and supported.

- **Real Conversations**: Step away from perfection. Join rooms created by moms like you, where they share raw, unfiltered experiences.
- **BuzzBoard Sharing**: Post about your struggles, ask questions, or simply express what's on your mind. Receive supportive comments and gentle encouragement from other moms walking a similar path.
- **Mom-to-Mom Gifting**: Send a flower from your Plant Library to someone who made you feel heard. Celebrate care with care.

## Iterations from Usability Tests

Through several rounds of moderated testing, we did informed iterations that helped refocus hierarchy and navigation.

We asked the participants to complete several scenarios and observed their movement patterns, mental models and ability to complete the tasks. Through multiple rounds of feedback, we were able to make thoughtful changes to layout, language, and flow to ease mental load and help support feel just a tap away.

### 1. Making rewards tangibles

Users couldn't find the reward plan and they were unsure what their progress was leading to.

**Insight**: Without a clear goal, motivation dropped over time. (Goal-Gradient Effect)

**Solution**: Introduced plant Library where users can easily track their growth and exchange matured plants for real-life vouchers; making progress feel more tangible and rewarding.

### 2. Reframing "Tasks" as "Nourishments"

"Tasks" felt like an obligation and chores and another burden for users.

**Insight**: (Cognitive Bias) Language affects perception and emotional response.(Framing Effect)

**Solution**: Renamed daily activities to "Nourishments", It softened the tone and helped users approach self-care as emotionally supportive actions rather than duties.

### 3. A/B Testing: Visibility vs. Anonymity in the community (Hive)

5/10 >> Half of the users preferred profile photos to feel connected to real people.

5/10 >> The other half valued anonymity to speak freely.

**Insight**: Different users have different privacy needs in sensitive communities.

**Solution**: Implemented a flexible profile setting, letting users choose how they show up.

## The Final MVP Product

After iterations and user testing, here's what the final Omaia MVP included:

### Onboarding + Signup

## Project Takeaways

Designing for emotion requires empathy, not assumption.

What looked good on paper didn't always resonate in practice. Early concepts rooted in behavioural models only became meaningful once tested with real postpartum mothers.

Real voices shifted our design direction.

Our initial design intentions were rooted in structure and flow, but through research and survey responses, we uncovered a deeper need for emotional validation, connection, and gentleness. These user insights became the true foundation of Omaia's direction; from tone and visuals to features and flow.
